# Guvi Zen Class Database

This repository contains the database schema and sample data for the Guvi Zen Class project.

## Schema

The `guviSchema.sql` file includes the SQL statements to create the database tables and their relationships.

## Sample Data

The `data.sql` file includes sample data for the `Students`, `Instructors`, `Courses`, and other tables.

## Setup

To set up the database:

1. Create a new database.
2. Run the `schema.sql` script to create tables.
3. Optionally, run the `data.sql` script to populate tables with sample data.

## Usage

Use SQL queries to interact with the database. For example, you can join tables to retrieve information about students, courses, and enrollments.
